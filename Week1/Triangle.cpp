/*Equilateral triangle: An equilateral triangle is a triangle in which all three sides are equal. In the familiar Euclidean geometry, equilateral triangles are also equiangular; that is, all three internal angles are also congruent to each other and are each 60Â°.

Isosceles triangle: An isosceles triangle is a triangle that has two sides of equal length.

Scalene triangle: A scalene triangle is a triangle that has three unequal sides, such as those illustrated above.
